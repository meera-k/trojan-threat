                <p>Emotet is a malware known to be used in cybercrime operations. First detected in 2014, it has remained active, though the primary servers for its operation were shut down due to police action in Germany and Ukraine. Believed to have originated in Russia, the trojan horse style virus was first meant to steal bank login information. Updated  between 2016 and 2017, it was repurposed to enable operators to load additional malware and malicious programs onto computers.</p>

                <p>As typical of many trojan horse viruses, it is mostly spread through email attachments containing Word documents. Appearing to be a legitimate reply to a previous message, the email may seem to contain invoices, shipping notices or even information about COVID-19. </p>

                <p>Once it has been installed on a device connected to a network, it is able to load tools onto the device to help it spread.</p>

                <p>So far, the main purpose of Emotet has been to construct botnets of infected computers, then to use these computers in what is called crimeware, or malware as a service. Access to the botnet may have been rented out, to other cybercrime groups.</p>

                <p>Besides using infected computers as a botnet, Emotet sometimes allowed the downloading of ransomware without the userâ€™s knowledge, encrypting data and demanding a fee to access it.  Anybody can be a target of this, and even some schools and police stations have been attacked in a similar way.</p>

                <p>The United States Department of Homeland Security estimates that the average Emotet incident causes 1 million dollars in damage. While basic cybersecurity awareness is helpful, many anti-virus softwares struggle to detect botnet malware such as Emotet. This is because it is polymorphic, meaning that the virus code changes each time it is called up. Be cautious opening any email attachment, even ones that seem to be safe file types like word documents, and contact the sender at a number or email address that you know to be theirs to double check.</p>
