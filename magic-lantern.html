              <h1>Magic Lantern</h1>

              <p>
                First reported in 2001, Magic Lantern is a Trojan horse type virus developed and used by the American FBI. Its main purpose is keylogging, specifically targeting the PGP password entered by the user. PGP, standing for Pretty Good Privacy, is used to increase the security of email communication and relies on a private and public key. With the Magic Lantern keylogger, the FBI is able to access the password used to start the PGP program, and through this, the user’s encrypted messages. As it is a Trojan horse, it is meant to deceive the target and be installed from an email attachment sent from a trusted friend or relative.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is currently unknown exactly how the virus stores or communicates the PGP key.
              </p>

              <p>
                The FBI has confirmed that Magic Lantern exists, but denies that it has ever been deployed and refuses to comment further. At the time of reporting, the most powerful tool the FBI had for internet and communications surveillance was Carnivore, a packet sniffing tool known to be employed between 1997 and 2005, and even this powerful tool was unable to access PGP encrypted communications.

                Uses
              </h2>

              <p>
                The FBI claims to have used Magic Lantern against identity theft, extortion, harassment, and other forms of cybercrime in 2005.

              <h2>
                Cool?
              </h2>

              <p>
                As always, many would say the potential positives of thwarting crime and terrorism outweigh the drawbacks of loss of privacy, but there are always risks with government use of surveillance tools. One example is that the keylogger could access all keystrokes, not just those related to encryption, even if a search is only authorized for the encryption password. Another concern is that the Federal magistrate judge in the most prevalent known case of use of Magic Lantern reportedly had no idea how the virus works. This raises questions as to whether somebody not educated in the tools they direct others to employ can accurately assess the risks and benefits of their own decision. On top of this, the program itself has never been explained to congress or the general public, adding to the list of unknown and relatively unrestricted surveillance powers the Government Intelligence community retains.

                Defense
              </h2>

              <p>
                In terms of potential defence, the best way to avoid Magic Lantern is to not run a massive drug trafficking organization, plan terrorist attacks or conspire against the American government. Staying off government watchlists can be difficult, but as long as you don’t plot mass murder you should be safe. As always, be careful when opening email attachments, and <b>never click on anything in an email from somebody you think would out you to the government.</b>
              </p>

              <h2>
                What about my anti-virus?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Many rely on programs such as Norton, or McAfee to alert them to security threats and unauthorized programs running on their devices. As usual, it is important to consider the actual values of the companies you interact with, as one sufficiently motivated by profit or possible avoidance of regulation may allow the government access to your data in ways that disadvantage you and other consumers. As recently as September 2020, Senate republicans introduced a “Lawful Access” bill intended to allow the government to force companies to reveal user data to courts, showing continued interest in undermining the right to privacy and encrypted communications in America. Despite constant pushes for government control over encryption, the FBI publicly admitted in 2018 that it had repeatedly misrepresented the amount of devices that it could not access due to a lack of encryption backdoor. All this leads consumers to concern that antivirus software companies may have been persuaded to allow certain government programs to run undetected. In 2007, CNET surveyed 13 prominent antivirus and security companies to question them on their communications with American government and their policy on government run software breaches. Most companies claim that they do not engage in requests for whitelisting programs from government officials, eEye co-founder Marc Maiffret going as far as to say  “As soon as a company, like we have seen with McAfee, starts making exceptions to their protection products, they can no longer guarantee a sound and safe product for their customers. We will not play that game.” McAfee, as pointed out by Maiffret provided much less certain answers, claiming that they detect spyware regardless of source, but will not comment on any communications with government officials.

                Keyloggers

              <p>
                Despite its target of PGP, the virus itself is similar to other keyloggers in the sense that it can log any keystroke made on a computer, including password entry and searches. This can be done with a software component or a hardware component. Fake USB drives or adapters can be accessed later and store keystrokes on internal memory, and wireless keyboard packets can be intercepted, with both approaches difficult to detect. Thankfully, these types of attacks are difficult to carry out as it requires direct access to the computer, and can be seen quite easily on a laptop. In terms of software, sometimes keyloggers are used by employers or other institutions on company owned computers to monitor network usage and resolve IT issues. Microsoft intentionally includes keylogging software with its Windows 10 operating system, and claims to use the data to improve writing softwares. Computer action logging also includes other data forms such as clipboard (copy & paste) logging, screen logging through the use of periodic discrete screenshots, and download logging.
